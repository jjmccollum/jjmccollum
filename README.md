### Welcome!

I'm interested in projects at the intersection of (digital) humanities and computer science.
The focus of my research is the adaptation and application of phylogenetic methods for textual criticism, specifically in the tradition of the Greek New Testament.
You'll find new tools for preparing transcription and collation data (especially in TEI XML format) for phylogenetic and other analyses on here as I continue to develop them according to my and others' needs.
Occasionally, I'll host textual transcriptions and data for digital editions on here.

I've also produced my own implementation of the Coherence-Based Genealogical Method (CBGM), an approach to textual criticism developed for open traditions like that of the New Testament.
The core library (https://github.com/jjmccollum/open-cbgm) and the command-line interface (https://github.com/jjmccollum/open-cbgm-standalone) are available here, and they are being incorporated into more user-friendly software by other developers on GitHub; I'll keep you posted as more updates become available!
